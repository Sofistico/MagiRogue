So you want to run this.

To run you need:
- Latest .Net sdk on your machine
- Optional: An IDE.

Run the MagiRogue project, it will compile the rest of the game and run it.
If using the CMD, run from root
```
dotnet run --project ./MagiRogue
```
If using an IDE, it's simple as well:
- VS: Select MagiRogue as the starter project, choose MagiRogue-TestMap or MagiRogue option
- VS Code: Need to install the required extensions to run dotnet projects, then just run the project!

What you need to do is run the test game, currently the start game option isn't working.
