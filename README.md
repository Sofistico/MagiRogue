# Description

MagiRogue is an immersive 2D grid-based roguelike game set in a world generated with a completely random history, including myths of how the world came to be. As you explore this world, you will encounter deep magic systems where the sky is the limit. From enchanting items to designing spells, every aspect of magic is at your fingertips. Be warned, some spells come with costs aside from the simple mana cost!

The game features an aura system where concentrated areas of aura often become warped and develop fun eldritch fauna. The physics-based material system is also deeply simulated, with intricate properties and interactions to explore. As you battle your way through the game, you can expect Dwarf Fortress levels of combat depth.

With GoRogue and SadConsole, MagiRogue is designed in ASCII graphics, providing a retro feel that is both nostalgic and captivating. This is a game that is sure to provide hours of entertainment and exploration, with an endless array of features to keep you engaged. So, prepare to enter the world of MagiRogue and unleash your magical abilities in a battle for survival!

In addition to the many features already mentioned, MagiRogue also includes the ability to create your own magic tower. After conquering one of the places with a deep magic aura, you can use the resources found there to build and customize your own tower. This tower can serve as your base of operations as you explore the world and develop your magical abilities.

The game also includes a coven of wizards, with deep master-apprentice relationships and intense wizard enmities. You will encounter a wide range of NPCs, each with their own unique personalities, agendas, and allegiances. As you interact with them, you will have the opportunity to forge alliances, make enemies, and navigate complex political landscapes.

As you progress through the game, you can play as an apprentice, honing your magical skills and climbing the ranks to become a powerful archmage. Alternatively, you can choose to abandon magic altogether and live as a common person, or even strive to become a god. The possibilities are endless in MagiRogue, and the choices you make will have a profound impact on your journey through the game.
